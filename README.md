### Studying through the career guide (Data scientist)
After finishing two modules of the course, it is proposed to carry out this project to solidify the knowledge learned so far.

The proposed challenge was to analyze whether the duration of films has become shorter over the years, we also saw that certain genres tend to have a much shorter duration.


 *The project is on Google Collaboration because all the content and projects are done within the platform with the DataCamp's own editor and shell, bringing the project to Google Collab was just one way, I could have put it in a jupyter notebook for example.*
